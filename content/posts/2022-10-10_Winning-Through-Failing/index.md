> “Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in getting up every time we do” - _Confucius_

Starting with a fairly over-used quote from an often misquoted philosopher. But regardless it continues to hold true and hold a deep message of perseverance that applies to every age/culture since the Tang Dynasty when Confucius shared his teachings some ~2500 years ago.


## Never falling?

Winning is great, it feels good to win and we are encouraged/celebrated for winning. The endorphine rush, the social/financial validation and pride of victory. But this can not always be the case.

Even the greatest and most talented experience the bitter sweet taste of defeat eventually in some form. And this is a defining moment, for it is not how we thrive in victory but rather how we overcome defeat that defines our character.

Our strongest lessons come from the times we have failed. 

Have a think now about some of these moments.

Learning to fail is a powerful trait, it doesn't mean you will always fail but rather that you've gained the ability to persevere through the adversity of loss when it appears.

Someone who has never tasted defeat can be destroyed by it when it finally hits. Whereas someone who is familiar will learn the lessons, brush it off and carry on.


## A recent simple but fitting example:

Another day doing some gym work, working through a set of sumo deadlifts when all of a sudden **OUCH💥**.

This was unfortunately not a new experience for me yet still I never truly learnt my lesson. I went to physio therapy, I did the stretches and once it was healed I continued as I was. So this lesson was bestowed upon me again, and again. Until finally this time, when I _finally_ heard it.

> Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. - _The Classic Proverb_

In this case it was was fooled more than twice, or thrice. But this time: instead of feeling the frustration of injury and the inconvenience that it brings, I stopped. And I thought on it.

Only now do I hear. And I am grateful, no more frustration but gratitude for the lesson highlighting what should be obvious.

Long story short, my butt is weak. Not my back. And so I _FINALLY_ know the way forward by addressing my weakness and turning it into a strength. You better believe I will be at all the booty workouts to learn how to train this ill-trained muscle of mine 🍑😂

Had I continued to treat the symptoms and not the cause, carrying on as I had been for many years this would no doubt only get worse before culminating in some serious damage further down the line.

So it's not how many times it takes you to learn the lesson but that you eventually _LEARN_ the lesson.

There is no room for pride here. Swallow it and do what is needed to progress.

## More powerful lessons

That was a simple and fairly meager example but the fundamentals are the same.

These lessons can come in many shapes and sizes, some of staggering magnitude that shatter your whole world image.

The higher the magnitude the more pressing the lesson. Sometimes it's a lesson we didn't know we needed. Sometimes it's putting an end to a frustrating struggle that wasn't sustainable. And sometimes it is just sadness, which too comes with it's own lessons.

There are a multitude of individual experiences that each of us will learn in different ways but the core process is the same.

> Turn the loss into learning and come back stronger.


## Fail harder

Personally I attribute some of my greatest turning points of success in my life to some of the lowest and most painful failures of my life. Without these I often wonder where and what I would be like today.

So transformative and humbling were these experiences that no doubt I would be a considerably different person without them. For better or worse I will never know. But despite this unknowing I must think it was for the better because it was these failures that put a stop to many harmful and negative traits. Had I to have kept winning despite these then there is no question I would have continued these traits, but for how long until the inevitable? Only to fall harder as I climbed higher? I am grateful I fell when I did.

So learn to love the failure, for it is just a feedback loop to come back and do better. Or perhaps a course correction that you never expected was needed. There is beauty in the breakdown and new opportunities arise from the ashes.
