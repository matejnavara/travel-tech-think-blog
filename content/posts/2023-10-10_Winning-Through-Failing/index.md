You shouldn't be here...

But since you're here anyway, have a gander.

I can't stop you anwyay. But remember, Jesus is watching.

> “Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in getting up every time we do” - _Confucius_

Starting with a fairly over-used quote from an often misquoted philosopher. But regardless it continues to hold true and hold a deep message of perseverance that applies to every age/culture since the Tang Dynasty when Confucius shared his teachings some ~2500 years ago.


## Thoughts on Winning

Winning is great, it feels good to win and we are encouraged/celebrated for winning. The endorphine rush, the social/financial validation and pride of victory. But this can not always be the case.

Even the greatest and most talented among us experience the bitter sweet taste of defeat eventually in some form. And this is a defining moment, for it is not how we thrive in victory but rather how we overcome defeat that defines our character.

Our strongest lessons come from the times we have failed. 

Have a think now about some of these moments.

Learning to fail is a powerful trait, it doesn't mean you will always fail but rather that you've gained the ability to persevere through the adversity of loss when it does appear.

Someone who has never tasted defeat can be destroyed by it when it finally hits. Whereas someone who is familiar will learn the lessons, brush it off and carry on.


## Not Learning the Lesson - by a recent simple but fitting example:

There I am at another day doing some gym work, working through a set of sumo deadlifts when all of a sudden **OUCH💥**.

This was unfortunately not a new experience for me yet still I never truly learnt my lesson. I went to physio therapy, I did the stretches and once it was healed I continued as I was. So focused on the outcome of recovery that my focus was on quickly treating the symptoms to "get back to it" rather than addressing the underlying cause.

So the lesson was bestowed upon me again, and again. Until _finally_ I got the message.

> Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. - _The Classic Proverb_

In this case I was fooled more than twice, or even thrice. But this time: instead of feeling the frustration of injury and the inconvenience that it brought, I stopped

I thought deeper on it. Analysed the why behind the failure.

Only then did I truly understand and I am grateful for it, no more frustration but gratitude for the lesson highlighting what had been raised a number of times.

Long story short, my butt is weak. Not my back. And understanding the cause I _FINALLY_ know the way forward by addressing this weakness and turning it into a strength. You better believe I will be at all the booty workouts to learn how to train this ill-trained muscle of mine 🍑😂

Had I continued to treat the symptoms and not the cause, carrying on as I had been for many years this would no doubt only get worse before culminating in some serious damage further down the line.

So it's not how many times it takes you to learn the lesson but that you eventually _LEARN_ that lesson.

There is no room for pride here. Swallow it and do what is needed to progress.

## Iteration over Perfection - by yet another relevant example

The fear of failure prevents many attempts at what could be great.

> Perfect is the enemy of great.

In fact perfectionism is just another form of procrastination, aiming for an unachievable goal it achieves the same output: nothing.

Eventually we must learn to fight our inner perfectionist and just do it. Whatever _it_ is.

For me this blog is a practice of that. Forgoing the extensive structuring, processing and proofing that would prevent me from producing another article.

It's not perfect but yet it's here. I've fallen off the habit but yet I'm back.

It doesn't matter if it's not perfect or if you've fallen out of a rhythm. The path forward is simply restarting and progressing on.

> Passion, patience and practice

I hope it will apply here too. As I write more, I will gain more feedback. Some may hit some may miss but I GAIN MORE FEEDBACK. And with more feedback I will iterate with emphasis on what works and what doesn't.And with that I will slowly discover my true writing style and perhaps some audience which it resonates with.

This feedback loop exists in all areas of life and the more feedback we receive the more 


## More powerful lessons

These were simple and fairly meager examples but the fundamentals are the same.

These lessons can come in many shapes and sizes, some of staggering magnitude that shatter your whole world image others just minor inconveniences.

The higher the magnitude the more pressing the lesson. Sometimes it's a lesson we didn't know we needed. Sometimes it's putting an end to a frustrating struggle that wasn't sustainable. And sometimes it's just heartbreaking, which too comes with it's own painful but important lessons.

There are a multitude of individual experiences that each of us will learn in different ways but the core process is the same.

> Turn the loss into learning and come back stronger.


## Winning through Failing

Personally I attribute some of my greatest turning points of success in my life to some of the lowest and most painful failures of my life. Without these I often wonder where and what I would be like today.

So transformative and humbling were these experiences that no doubt I would be a considerably different person without them. For better or worse I will never know. But despite this unknowing I must think it was for the better because it was these failures that put a stop to many harmful and negative traits. Had I kept "succeeding" (or rather not failing) despite these then there is no question I would have continued these negative traits, but for how long until the inevitable? Only to fall harder as I climbed higher. I am grateful I fell when I did.

So learn to love the failure, for it is just a feedback loop to come back and do better. Or perhaps a course correction that you never knew was needed. There is beauty in the breakdown and new opportunities arise from the ashes.

"Fail Fast" is a popular silicon valley methodology for a reason.

So next time something doesn't go to plan or you don't succeed as expected, take a moment to see the potentials in that moment. The lessons identified, the room for improvement.

Let it drive you forward, not hold you back.
