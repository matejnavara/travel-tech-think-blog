# What is Raja Ampat?

Located in the far east of Indonesia, off the northwest tip of Bird's Head Peninsula in West Papua you will find this legendary archipelago. A collection of hundreds of jungle covered islands containing some of the highest biodiversity in the world. Both above and below the water you’ll find endemic species found nowhere else on the planet and quite uniquely biologists continue to find new species year after year.

The natural beauty and uniqueness of this region has become world renowned bringing visitors from all over to this faraway land. In recent years the number of domestic and international tourists has been growing rapidly. Until 2020.

With the current travel situation it was a unique opportunity to see these beautiful islands with less than 1% of the usual visitor numbers. The seas were empty, the dive sites quiet and most resort islands uninhabited. Although devastating for local businesses it has given the environment a chance to catch its breath and flourish.

So in March 2021 we assembled our pirate posse and departed for Raja Ampat from our base in Bali.

# Getting There

Raja Ampat is far and some steps are required to get here.

In general it’ll be:

- **AIR** - A few flights to reach Sorong (SOQ) in West Papua
- **LAND** - A taxi/motorbike from the airport to the harbour
- **SEA** - A ferry/speedboat to the island of Waisai, the gateway to Raja Ampat.

Apparently you can also fly straight to Waisai from Sorong via light aircraft if it’s available (we didn’t even think of this).

The details of this transit are ever changing, particularly during the current pandemic situation, so I recommend checking [HERE](https://www.stayrajaampat.com/ultimate-raja-ampat-guide/information/how-to-get-to-raja-ampat/) for more detailed/updated travel info.

## AIR

Whether flying domestically or internationally you will most likely have to connect via one of the main international airports of Jakarta or Makkasar to get to Sorong.

Our pirate posse departing from Bali split across both routes and rendezvoused at the Sorong harbour (with some of us almost missing the boat!).

## LAND

When you get out of Sorong airport there will be no shortage of drivers offering to drive you to the harbour. It will be a flat 100k IDR (£5 / €5.80 / \$7) for the ride which will take 10-20 minutes depending on traffic.

## SEA

From there you can get the public ferry ticket to Waisai for another 100k or 125k for “VIP” if you’re into excessive air-con and slightly nicer seats (the regular seats have air-con too). This boat will rarely leave on schedule but it’s worth arriving on time regardless, there’s only 2 a day and sometimes they cancel trips based on demand. Considering I was on team late pirates and arrived 30 minutes after the departure I was definitely grateful for the relaxed approach to the schedule!

This ferry will take about 1.5-3 hours so get comfy, read a book, have a nap, stare at the sea, do whatever you want as you make the slow crossing to Waisai harbour.

You can also get a speed boat if you’re in a hurry. Apparently this is 600k-800k per person and takes about half the time.

## Welcome to Raja Ampat.

If your tour operator didn’t already pick you up at Sorong airport they will most likely pick you up from Waisai harbour which was our case. Close to the Waisai harbour is probably the last time to get cash, SIM cards and extra supplies if you haven’t already so think carefully.

It’s also here you will pay the 1,000,000 IDR (£50 / €58 / \$70) Marine Park Entrance fee that all tourists in Raja Ampat must pay before entering the national park. You will be directed to the tourist information center where you will need to present your passport and pay the fee. Expect to pay this in cash even if they mention they accept cards (the machine seems to work every time, about 20% of the time)...

Then it’s time to begin the Raja Ampat expedition!

Plans can vary for different lengths, budgets and preferences.

- **Land-based**, staying at one homestay and getting boats to/from different islands each day. This does limit how much you can see since the boats can only go so far on a day trip. The return journeys will also drive up the fuel costs, the biggest factor for cost.

- **Island safari**, staying in multiple places across different islands as you sail around the park. This is definitely a nice middle-ground that still allows you to go further into Raja Ampat. However you have to stay on inhabited islands and will still be limited by the boat’s range from these.

- **Liveaboard**, staying on a boat the entire time. This gives you full freedom to sail further and to any islands regardless if they’re inhabited. Definitely the best option but usually the most costly.

We opted for the latter, especially since the costs dropped considerably due to the lower demand. Will cover trip costs later.

Regardless of which type of trip you choose it’ll be an unforgettable experience. Given the distance and size of the area I would say go for at least a week to make the most of it. Of course it’s possible to do less but you will see less and be more rushed. The more the merrier (funds permitting…)

# Preparation

It’s remote and pretty wild so you’ll want to take a few things. Get as much as you can before you leave because the selection in West Papua is limited and expensive.

- **Waterproof bags.** You can get quite wet during boat trips or transfers between different islands.
- **A reusable bottle.** Let’s keep Raja Ampat as free of disposable plastic bottles as possible.
- **Reef safe sunscreen.** Protect the reefs you love. Also definitely won’t be easy to find this in West Papua.
- **Mosquito repellent and antimalarial medication.** West Papua is a malaria zone so if you get bitten regularly it’ll be wise to get the antimalarials; start them before, take them during and continue after returning. All as your doctor/pharmacist prescribes. You definitely don’t want malaria.
- **Diving/snorkelling gear.** Probably will be on sale but much more expensive.
- **First aid kits and hygiene products.** Again anything out there will be limited/costly. There are no “organic” or “bio” soaps or shampoos and FYI for women: there are no tampons available, only sanitary pads.

On arriving, get a Telkomsel SIM card in Sorong or Waisai. It is the only provider that has any signal in the park. Ask a taxi to take you to a “kantor Telkomsel.” It normally costs 150.000 IDR for a new sim card and 12 gb of data.

# Our Pirate Expedition

With all the practical tips of transit/preparation out the way I will give an account of our experience and trip.

We went for an 8 days/ 7 Nights liveaboard with Barefoot focusing on a mix of diving (2-3 dives a day) and other sea/land activities. There are many possibilities and itineraries, but this one is ours.

So after arriving to Raja Ampat and staying one night at the Dive Republic resort in Wasai we set sail aboard the A’Boya.

## **Day 1** - _Friday 19th March 2021_

On a calm Friday afternoon we jumped on the dinghies over to the A’Boya. A fine vessel with a hearty crew.

After getting acquainted with the ship and where everything was during the briefing from the organiser we settled into our home for the next week. All 9 of us pirates spread across 3 bedrooms sleeping 3/4/2. Cosy indeed.

Somehow I got sunburnt already… I guess it is the equator after all.

The day rounded off with a check dive at a nearby island, nothing mindblowing just yet as we’re still close to the harbour but good to test the equipment.

Dried off, ate dinner and konked out.

Welcome aboard.

## **Day 2** - _Saturday 20th March 2021_

First proper day sailing out after some last minute engine troubles got resolved. (Always something to fix on a boat!)

We sailed out to a “Bat Island” appropriately named for the sheer number of fruit bats that swam the treetops. Some also call it “Cat Island” because a number of cats live on the beaches, apparently dumped by locals from other islands.

Bat/Cat Island was too tempting not to explore so we grabbed the dinghies over for some chilling on the white sand beaches.

Beautiful island.

Back on the ship we noticed a neighbouring vessel, the only ship in sight and parked a few hundred metres away turned out to be that of a friend from back in Bali. What a small world. So we boarded their impressive boat with some beers, rum (arak) and rowdiness. Good social night under the stars before stumbling back into our homeward bound dinghy.

The combination of some liquor and the rocking of the boat put us all right to sleep.

Good night.
