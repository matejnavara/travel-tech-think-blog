## TL;DR

###### (To Long; Didn't Read)

I would love to hear any input of what is your _“why”_ or any feedback on something you may disagree with. This was written in one sitting on a warm Indonesian evening and honestly, it feels nice. A little brain dump of thoughts harking back to reason 1.

Thank you for taking the time today to ingest my words.

This blog will become a home of 3 types of content:

- **Travel**: Experiences, tips, guides and recommendations from different destinations I stumble through.
- **Tech**: Walkthroughs, tutorials, hacks and discussions as I bumble through the ever changing tech landscape.
- **Thoughts**: Ideas, questions, debates and theories on things that may wander though my mind.

Stay tuned ✨
