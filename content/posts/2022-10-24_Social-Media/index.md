You shouldn't be here...

But since you're here anyway, have a gander.

I can't stop you anwyay. But remember, Jesus is watching.

Social media platforms have become a prevalent part of our daily lives, pulling our attention from UP THERE ðŸŒ‡ to DOWN HERE ðŸ“² whilst we're in bed, on the toilet or out with friends.

Often it's just second nature, a bizarre habit that formed and before you know it you're scrolling through random cat videos or memes.

Now don't get me wrong I do love a good meme and there are plenty of positive elements of social media use:

- Connecting with friends / family from afar
- Learning something new
- Getting some inspiration
- Unwinding and laughing

*BUT* there are plenty of negative elements that I'm sure we can all recognise:

- Disconnecting from friends / family physically around you
- Envy / depression / self-consciousness  
- Doom-scrolling
- Time wasting

So how do we weigh these up? Where do we draw the line? What separates healthy use and unhealthy use?

These are the questions I wish to bring to the forefront and start open discussions about how / why we use these platforms.

# But first things first, let's rewind a bit and get some context.

## If you were born in the 1900s read here:

Okay fellow old-timers we recall a time without portable devices let alone social media platforms. That means there was a point in which they slowly crept into our life and were steadily (usually voluntarily or even actively) adopted as a standard every day habit.

Habits do not form out of nowhere, so a quick thought exercise for you:

> When / why did you first get a mobile device

> When / why did you first join a social media platform?

> What kept you coming back?


## If you were born in the 2000s read here:

As GenZ and beyond you are the first "Digital Natives"; surrounded by tech, mobile devices and social media from maybe before you could walk. That is an interesting dynamic and quite frankly an unprecedented one. On one side you've had access to mass connection / information from the get go (see the positives above), on the other side you've also experienced the pitfalls from the same point (see negatives above).

I've already outed myself as an oldie but I still want to ask you similar three questions.

> Do you recall the first time you were given a mobile device? (Phone/Tablet/Laptop/etc)

> Did / do you feel pressure in school based on what device you had or your social media presence?

> What would your days look like without any devices?


## Now read on regardless of age:
The reason I start with this is to get you in the frame of mind that these devices/platforms are not a defacto. They are adopted, by us, seemingly willingly. And likewise they can be un-adopted, by us, hopefully willingly.

Though they seem like omnipotent behemoths they are just the current establishment. Bigger institutions have come and gone. What will be the status quo in 5 years? In 20 years? In 50 years? Well that will be for us to decide since we *choose* which platform to focus our attention on and these platforms constantly compete for that attention.

**Make no mistake, in the digital age we are constantly voting with where we put our attention.**

# The Good

# The Bad

# The Ugly


# Why are we discussing this?
 - Time use
 - General unsatisfaction


# How can we change the way things are?
- "But this is just how things are"
- "What difference will my choice make?" - 7 billion people

- Social media breaks
- Controlled use (evenings/weekends)
- Intentional use (self-reflection and analysis)


# What does good / healthy use look like?
- Now this is million dollar question. How to enjoy the positives without the negatives.
- Is there a healthy balance?
