It is long. It isn't proof read or spellchecked. There will be bugs and typos.

Don't judge. You have been warned. Now go forth;

# **#100DaysOfCode Part 4** _(Day 61-80)_

## Day 61 - 30/04/2021

Start of part 4/5 is making this awfully real! The time is ticking and I want this app "done" by the end.

We will define what this definition of DONE means but it should be a functional MVP that is shareable.

As for this day I will do a little bit of housekeeping on the app front, noticed some oversights after returning from backend-land.

1. Redux actions not used consistently.

2. API is missing some App routes and controller/service structure

3. Categories are still pulling from constants.

Will hit the first now, second tomorrow and third day after. Busy days are limiting the time sadly.

Simple changes:

## Day 62 - 01/05/2021

Now the 2nd day of housekeeping on May Day.

Back in API land adding the necessary App routes for Categories we'll need for fix numero 3. Also restructuring to match the controller/services of the Admin App.

A much neater route.

Calling the Categories from the API. These won't change often so perhaps just an initial call on load to update the store with some basic fallback to begin with for now.
