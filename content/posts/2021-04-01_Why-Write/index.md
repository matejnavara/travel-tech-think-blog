> “Apparently a picture says a thousand words, but a thousand words paints a pretty good picture.” - _Me?_

Was pretty proud of that one but let me know if it’s already been said (after all everything is a remix). Happened to come to my mind yesterday whilst thinking of what to write for this opening article. An otherwise miscellaneous thought that would have been destined to the recesses of my mind until it faded away and became forgotten.

But now it had a purpose. It could be used. Written and **stored**.

The joy of this can be periodically/randomly stumbling across these at a later date only to be reminded of the people, space and circumstances in which they were formed.

So here lies the first reason to write:

### _**1. To store thoughts/ideas.**_

Some might be silly and useless, but others can be so much more.

# Introduction

Anyway I’m getting ahead of myself, first let me introduce who I am and what I hope to achieve with yet another blog in a blogging network blogged to the blog with blogging blogs.

**My name is Matej Navara and I am not a writer.**

I come from a software engineering background; developing games/apps/sites/APIs/etc. Geeky tech stuff that now the whole world uses on a daily basis. This side is my brain and the engine driving forward.

Another side of me is the hopeless adventurer forever yearning to discover what is over _“there”_. Growing up on Indiana Jones and Tomb Raider I longed for adventures in faraway tropical lands with unique food, serene vistas and strange creatures bigger than they should be. This side is my heart and the steering wheel that defines the path.

These two parts of me are what I guess could be broad definitions of _“who I am”_ now. Travelling developer? Code vagabond? ~~Digital nomad?~~

But we are all more than our basic labels. No one’s job/hobby/passion defined them in their entirety although it does give a rough overview of who they may be.

Now enough about all that. The subject at hand is clear:

# Why Write?

As far as we know, humans have been writing since [3,400BC](https://www.historyextra.com/period/ancient-egypt/cuneiform-6-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-the-worlds-oldest-writing-system/) and drawing since [45,000BC](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2264793-worlds-oldest-painting-of-animals-discovered-in-an-indonesian-cave/). **That’s a very long time!**

So what compelled this? At the surface these actions don’t seem to have any significant survival benefits, _or do they_?

Being able to **share** knowledge without both parties being physically present was a game-changer. Warnings could be indicated at dangerous locations, best feeding grounds could be passed between individuals, directions to the best beach could be shared. The possibilities were endless.

And as we can see they truly are, fast forward 47,021 years and you’re reading this English scripture off an application written in ReactJS with Typescript, which compiles down to Bytecode and runs on your device with machine code.

We’ve come a long way from _“watch out for bears”_.

So here comes another reason, and it’s a big one:

### _**2. To share knowledge.**_

![Knowledge](https://media.giphy.com/media/TI32JwHmWQEi4/giphy.gif)

Ultimately that may be the core reason for why we write. But there is a whole other side of it, a side which doesn’t share crucial knowledge. Instead it makes up stories, jokes and lies purely for the sake of entertainment or because we can. From great Greek epics to your favourite dad joke, these works were the manifestation of **imagination**.

A force so powerful that it has spawned things into existence that would otherwise not have been. The people who imagined we would fly despite all the talk of how _“impossible”_ it is. This reason for writing is for the dreamers, the poets, the writers of imaginary worlds that defy all bounds. Without these individuals we wouldn’t have some of the greatest innovations/stories that have inspired many more. It is quite simply, painting with words.

So for the next reason we have:

### _**3. To express imagination.**_

Another very epic reason I am sure we can all agree.

So how do we top the last 2? Well I guess we don’t or maybe we do.

There’s a reason that has provided comfort and healing to countless individuals, though rather contradictory to the previous points as it often stays hidden/private. Yet this does not diminish the power that it has had throughout the ages.

It's the act of personal **reflection**; be it in a diary, journal, memoir, sketchbook, note taking app or the back of a reciept it all accomplishes the same goal. To reflect and process thoughts. The simple act of writing has an almost meditative quality and these thoughts have been expressed many times over by individuals far more eloquent in writing than myself.

So here are a few:

### “I can shake off everything as I write; my sorrows disappear, my courage is reborn.” - _Anne Frank_

---

### “Journaling is like whispering to one’s self and listening at the same time.”- _Mina Murray_

---

### “We do not learn from experience… We learn from reflecting on experience.” - _John Dewey_

---

And here lies the root of why this came about. Why I am writing this and why (I hope) you are still reading. I discovered the simple joy and release of writing through doing exactly that; writing.

On 13th September 2020 after hearing many people swear by the power of journaling I thought I’d give it a shot. My handwriting is horrendous and I’m definitely no poet but ultimately that wasn’t the point.

Here is my first entry:

Since then I have been making an entry pretty much every day, the format grew to include Location, Date, Time, Mood and even the occassional drawing (I'm also definitely no artist).

![Entry format](./images/journal-2.jpeg)

Without noticing, it gave me such comfort during what was a difficult time and looking back through the pages you can see snapshots of these moments. Most importantly you can see how the Mood became ever more positive. Although that’s not necessarily the only reason, as there are lots of factors in daily life, but it definitely had a positive impact.

The simple act of writing it down, takes the load off your mind and puts it onto paper (be it physical or digital). That is a very powerful and good reason to write.

### _**4. To reflect and process experiences.**_

![Reflect](https://media.giphy.com/media/l2SpXaJA67JaSqSxq/giphy.gif)

And upon reflection that’s a pretty good place to leave it. Of course there are numerous reasons for why we write but I believe these are some of the big league reasons that we can all agree on.

## TL;DR

###### (To Long; Didn't Read)

### _**1. To store thoughts/ideas.**_

### _**2. To share knowledge.**_

### _**3. To express imagination.**_

### _**4. To reflect and process experiences.**_

I would love to hear any input of what is your _“why”_ or any feedback on something you may disagree with. This was written in one sitting on a warm Indonesian evening and honestly, it feels nice. A little brain dump of thoughts harking back to reason 1.

Thank you for taking the time today to ingest my words.

This blog will become a home of 3 types of content:

- **Travel**: Experiences, tips, guides and recommendations from different destinations I stumble through.
- **Tech**: Walkthroughs, tutorials, hacks and discussions as I bumble through the ever changing tech landscape.
- **Thoughts**: Ideas, questions, debates and theories on things that may wander though my mind.

Stay tuned ✨
