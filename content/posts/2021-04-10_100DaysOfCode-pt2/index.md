# **#100DaysOfCode Part 2** _(Day 21-40)_

## Day 21 - 21/03/2021

Another day another code.

I realise the writeup for part 1 was quite long so I will keep the notes a bit more summative unless there is some cool discovery/process.

Today is coverting components day. JSX -> TSX.

Here is one I prepared earlier:

![TSX convert](./images/day21-motivication-progress.png)

Overall a few lines lighter than PropTypes.

## Day 22 - 22/03/2021

Today finished up the TSX conversion. Feels good man.

Going forward everything will be written in Typescript and I will clean up any remaining bits as I move forward. Starting with removing `Constants/PropTypes.js` constants and the dependency:

```
yarn remove prop-types
```

~~Refactor into Typescript~~

Happy days ðŸŽ‰

## Day 23 - 23/03/2021

Today is a friend's birthday on the boat and we finally returned to some reception zone so I can push up all the changes.

Let's look at the latest ToDos:

### Offline Raja Ampat Boat Coding ToDos
  * ~~Create saved motivications screen~~
  * ~~Create motivication modal display~~
  * ~~Refactor into Typescript~~
  * Add Redux (maybe Sagas)
  * Start Motivication API
  * Better Quote modal styling (responsive font size)
  * Better Alarm cards
  * Better Quote cards


Today I will start moving into some styling to improve the cards/modals.
